## THIS PROJECT IS NOW ARCHIVED
Unfortunately, due to the changes made by Google on how Android allows access to SMS, Termux's capability to send and receive texts has been removed. I had a bigger vision for SMSPy but we can't change Google's decision. Nonetheless, I had fun experimenting with SMSPy.

## Requirements & Dependencies
This will not work in Windows or non-Android systems.

- Android Phone
- Mobile Number and SMS Credits
